WARRANT CANARY
***************

No warrants have ever been served to me, 5atoshiNakamoto, by this pseudonym or by my real given name and legal government ID (e.g. to hand out private signing keys, or to introduce backdoors to any project in which I'm involved, in so far as I know), nor have any searches or seizures taken place of my own space.

5atoshiNakamoto has not received:

 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a broad order for user metadata
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a broad order for user data
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a targeted order for user data
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a targeted order for user metadata

5atoshiNakamoto has never received a legal order enforceable in his or her jurisdiction for user data.

5atoshiNakamoto has never received a legal order enforceable in his or her jurisdiction for any broad class of users.

5atoshiNakamoto has never received a gag order preventing disclosure of any broad order.

A gag order refers to any legal order enforceable in 5atoshiNakamoto's jurisdiction preventing disclosure of:

 * A request or order for investigative assistance
 * A request or order for technical assistance
 * Any other request, order, demand, or information of any type


****************
DEADLINE UPDATE
****************

The next canary statement is planned to be published within 3 months, before 21, April, 2025.

*Special note should be taken if no new canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements change without plausible explanation.*


**************
PROOF OF DATE
**************

PROOF OF DATE is currently best demonstrated utilizing a combination of two(2) tools:

(1) Printing a very recent Bitcoin block hash demonstrates that this canary could not have been created PRIOR to the date and time of the Bitcoin block height stated (3 blocks back [~30 minutes] to protect against likelihood of block reorganization), and

(2) Verifying the hash of this canary.txt file timestamped on https://OpenTimestamps.org and included in the Bitcoin blockchain demonstrates that this canary could not have been created AFTER the date and time stated.

Thus, a narrow window between these two results is the only plausible date and time for the creation and timestamped signature of this canary.

(1) A very recent Bitcoin block hash:
000000000000000000019058c532af98b1f2a56ce36cce1b130d625e146367a4

Block: 880305

(You can easily view evidence of this Bitcoin block hash at a website like:
https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000019058c532af98b1f2a56ce36cce1b130d625e146367a4)

(2) Next, verify the matching hashes of the following files on https://OpenTimestamps.org and that it is included in a Bitcoin block sufficiently close in date and time to Block 880305 from Step 1.

Download the two files at:
* https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary.txt.ots
* https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary.txt

Then at https://OpenTimestamps.org, first drag (or otherwise, 'upload') the .txt.ots proof file into the STAMP & VERIFY box, followed by the .txt stamped file into the box below it.

The files should both display a matching hash and the Bitcoin block height and time in which this hash was included.

Compare this Bitcoin block height and time to Block 880305. Each block represents ~10 minutes.


********************
DISCLAIMERS & NOTES
********************

(1) No data within any files are actually uploaded to the servers at https://OpenTimestamps.org in the process of creating or verifying this timestamp. Only a SHA256 hash function occurs within the privacy of one's browser. In the timestamp creation process, only the hash of the file is included among many others in a Merkle tree of a subsequent Bitcoin block.

(2) This scheme is not infallible. Although signing this declaration makes it difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force—or other means like blackmail or compromise of the signer's laptop(s), for example—to coerce one to produce false declarations.

(3) This declaration is merely a best effort and provided without any guarantees, warranty, and is not legally binding in any way to anyone. No signer should ever be held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.

(4) Failure to update this canary does not necessarily mean 5atoshiNakamoto has received a gag order; nor is not updating it—or omitting anything—an attempt to communicate anything to anyone. Frankly, it's also entirely plausible that 5atoshiNakamoto could have become otherwise incapacitated or lazy with his or her systems management of this website, leaving this canary to expire, but let's hope not. Have you asked him or her? This canary serves only to periodically confirm certain facts as long as they are presently true.

(5) Compromise of the associated Github account, 5atoshiNakamoto, or PGP private key remains always a remote possibility.

(6) Doing the best we can.
