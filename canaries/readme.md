# Warrant Canaries

Each of the .txt files below can be copied and pasted into this <a href="https://keybase.io/verify" target="_blank">Keybase Verify</a> tool to easily check the validity of the signature against [5atoshiNakamoto's PGP key](/pgp.html). 

Instructions for validating each canary's Proof of Date and respective hash (timestamped on <a href="https://OpenTimestamps.org" target="_blank">OpenTimestamps.org</a> and included in the Bitcoin blockchain) are detailed in the PROOF OF DATE section of each canary. 

## Current

@5atoshiNakamoto's most current warrant canary can be found at [https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary](https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary)

## Upcoming

The next canary statement is planned to be signed and published within 6 months, **on or before <code>19, July 2026</code>**.

*Special note should be taken if no new canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements change without plausible explanation.*
