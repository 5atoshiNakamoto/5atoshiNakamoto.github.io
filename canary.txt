No warrants have ever been served to me, 5atoshiNakamoto, by this pseudonym

in so far as I know), nor have any searches or seizures taken place of my own space.

DISCLAIMERS & NOTES
********************

This scheme is not infallible. Although signing this declaration makes 
it difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, 
it does not prevent them from using force—or other means like blackmail 
or compromise of the signer's laptop(s), for example—to coerce one to 
produce false declarations.

The bitcoin block hash quoted below (PROOF OF DATE) serves to demonstrate 
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date and bitcoin 
block height stated; it shows that a series of canaries were not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and provided without any guarantees, 
warranty, and is not legally binding in any way to anyone. No signer should 
ever be held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.

Failure to update this canary does not mean 5atoshiNakamoto has received 
a gag order, nor is not updating it or omitting anything an attempt to 
communicate anything to anyone. This canary serves only to periodically 
confirm certain facts as long as they are true.

Compromise of the associated Github account, 5atoshiNakamoto, remains 
always a remote possibility.
